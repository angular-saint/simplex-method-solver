# Simplex Method Solver (C++)

This project is a C++ implementation of the **Simplex algorithm** for solving linear programming problems.
The user enters the objective function and constraints via standard input, and the program computes the optimal solution.

##  Features
- Interactive console input
- Solves maximization problems
- Displays results after computation
- Educational and academic-friendly implementation

##  Algorithm Overview
The Simplex method is an iterative optimization algorithm used to solve linear programming problems by traversing the vertices of the feasible region.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Language: C++
- Standard Library (STL)

##  How to Run
```bash
g++ simplex.cpp -o simplex
./simplex
